### Explanation of Dependencies:

- **tensorflow==2.11.0**: This is the main library used for building and training the neural network models. It also includes Keras for defining and training deep learning models.
- **numpy==1.23.3**: A core library for numerical computing in Python. It’s used for working with arrays and matrices.
- **pandas==1.5.1**: Provides data manipulation tools that might be useful when working with structured datasets.
- **matplotlib==3.6.2**: A plotting library to visualize the training process and results.
- **scikit-learn==1.1.2**: A library for machine learning, particularly useful for evaluating and testing models (e.g., confusion matrices, classification reports).
- **Pillow==9.2.0**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork, used to load, process, and display images in the GUI.
- **seaborn==0.11.2**: Built on top of matplotlib, it makes it easier to generate statistical plots like heatmaps and bar charts.
- **opencv-python==4.6.0.66**: OpenCV is a computer vision library used for image processing tasks.
- **scipy==1.9.3**: Useful for scientific and technical computing, often used in conjunction with numpy.
- **h5py==3.7.0**: This is used to read and save Keras models in `.h5` format.
